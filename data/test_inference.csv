1,Civil Victims,"The Civil Victims were born in an old squatter barracks of the Civil Guard, in Barceloneta, in 2003, during the massive protests against the Second Iraq War. The arrival to the house of Valencian immigrant poet Hector Arnau supposed a communion in exile that led to an unlikely pact: in the future no less likely, Hector, with his poems and Pau Miquel Soler, with their rhythms, would give birth to a disc whose name was then ""40 Years of Success of Spanish Post-Francoism"". Many moons later, after various artistic attempts, Arnau, with several poems published and taken to the scene and Soler, with the experience as leader of Arthur Caravan, took up the old promise and allied with the ""Caravanian"" comrades Pau Aracil and Toni Blanes, and the trumpet player of the group Polonio, Ernest Aparici, to assemble a carnival punk-rock band that combines the most ludic musical wishes with lyrical and / or humorous lyrics, always fleshed out in the critics. With a few months behind the worst of the prophecies, in 2016 and with the long and heavy shadow of the dictator on social-political coexistence in these lands, here are these successes of the post-Franco homeland that seek to instruct and make dance at the same time both the popular classes and the most circumspect intellectuals."
2,Concert God Save the Queen,"Returns to Spain the largest and most impressive show of Queen, described by Rolling Stone magazine as ""The best show about Queen of all time.""

After 20 years of consecutive success, God Save The Queen presents its greatest show in history. The band number 1 of Tribute to Queen of the world celebrates its 20 years of career, after having been chosen by 20th Century Fox & Queen to promote the official film of the band ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" with its most ambitious show, emulating all the stages of Queen's career, with an emphasis on the Live Aid concert of 195

God Save The Queen will make 80 presentations around the world, which will take them to Europe, Latin America, USA, Japan and for the first time to Southeast Asia.

The band celebrates the creation of a new concept in shows, this time oriented for the massive spaces, where it proposes a journey without respite for the career of QUEEN, from 1973 to 1995, with themes to get excited like Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You or We Are The Champions."
3,Organ Concerts in the Church of Sant Miquel,"Every Friday, coinciding with the market day in Llucmajor, a small organ concert is held in the parish church of Sant Miquel de Llucmajor. The concert will be offered by the organist Crist√É¬≥bal Barros Vidal (1957), in an organ that once belonged to the church of Santa Eul√É¬†lia in Palma and in 1912 he moved to Llucmajor. Built by the Swiss Ludwig Scherrer in 1804, with a facade designed by the priest Miguel Salv√É¬°, in 1984 the organ was restored by the German Gerhard Grenzing."
